# Speedrunning Simulator 2022

## Original pitch: 
> I did just have a silly idea.
> You remember those old flash games that was like 'Shopping Cart Launcher'
> where you'd have a minigame where you'd earn money.
> 
> Then you'd spend the money on upgrades, to improve your performance in the
> minigame.
> 
> What if the minigame is "speedrunning" and your upgrades are thigns like
> "programmer socks", "brazillian grey-market HRT", and "polycule that formed
> on the <game> discord server"
> 
> [...]
> 
> Maybe the speedrunning minigame would be a simple platformer? Maybe it's just
> 1-1; and upgrades provide things like 'mario speeds up', 'timer slows down',
> and 'get a double-jump'.

Idea is pretty much what the pitch above has. The game is a loving homage to
speedrunning and the prevalence of trans femmes in the community. The framing
device is that the main character is a trans femme "egg" who is streaming their
speedrun attempts on a fictional streaming platform "Fidget".

## Gameplay 
The player will do a speedrunning minigame, using "money" earned (called
Nybbles; parallel to Bits on Twitch) on joke upgrades that are references and
memes within the trans femme community. 

The goal is to get the player to get a taste of the speedrunning experience;
and experiencing the ability to get better at a single game and improving their
skill and knowledge over time. Though to help enable this feeling; upgrades
will include things such as timers slowing down, double jumps, and skill that
allow bypassing obstacles. 

To maintain a constant pace, the game will reward Nybbles every run. Though
rewards are calculated via how close the player is to beating the world record,
granting a major bonus for beating a WR; to help encourage the speedrunner
mindset. But to help for players who are not as skilled, we will also implement
upgrades that provide a constant and ever increasing source of Nybbles.
Justified in story by the main character gaining a loyal audience by streaming
consistently, and being an entertaining streamer.

## Story 
The story is a basic plot about a depressed egg at the low-point of their life,
who gets into speedrunning in a desperate attempt to gain some kind of meaning
from their life. From connecting with the speedrunning community, they (at
first) start presenting as femme as a way to get advantages in speedrunning;
before earnestly attempting to transition socially and medically to ease gender
dysphoria. Who at the end of the game, manages to break out of their
depression, and gets a fulfilling life.

Potential plot beats could involve the following;
- Start of Act 1: MC is broke, working at a gas station, and only has a their
                  retro game console to pass the time. "Might as well start
                  streaming"
  - End of Act 1: MC realizes they're actually trans
- Start of Act 2: Joins a trans femme community, who encourages her to speedrun
                  more and helps her gain followers.
  - End of Act 2: Gaining a community and feeling fulfilled
- Start of Act 3: MC Explores their gender more, becoming more powerful.
  - End fo Act 3: Having the self-confidence to learn a new skill; which leads
                  to a better job and she feels fulfilled in life. Still
                  keeping in touch with the speedrunning community.

## Art
To help keep the scope limited, we will be using a limited palette and pixel
art. Most of the game will be UI driven using text boxes and buttons. While a
single "frame" will be used to show the TV that the platformer will be played
within. 

To help simplify the background creation process; I think a 1-bit style
(featuring two colours from our palette) would make it easier to create the art
and likewise provide a striking look. It will also help illustrate the
depressing atmosphere that the MC finds themselves in, deemphasizing everything
but the game that they love.

To maybe also help illustrate the mental shifts that happen during different
points in the game; the backgrounds could shift colours. Which will help
eliminate the need for new assets, and help convey the story through art
design.

As for the platformer, I believe to help it stand out if it used a different
colourscheme; perhaps using assets and their default colours. Doubly so if
they're bright and colourful graphics, to act as contrast with the rest of the
world. Enhancing the sense of "escapism" that we would want from a story
perspective.

The palette used will be based on this palette found from Coolors.com (which,
for reference, is the same palette used on AnnaLee's personal website):
https://coolors.co/palette/ffcdb2-ffb4a2-e5989b-b5838d-6d6875
- Apricot:          #FFCDB2
- Melon:            #FFB4A2
- Pastel Pink:      #E5989B
- English Lavender: #B5838D
- Old Lavender:     #6D6875

And the font used will be a bitmap/pixel font. The prototype uses the free font
"Connection" which was obtained through the following link;
https://fontlibrary.org/en/font/connection
Which I believe would be a good font to use for the final product.
